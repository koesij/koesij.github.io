## Machine-learning certification of multipartite entanglement for noisy quantum hardware

>We develop a certification pipeline that feeds the statistics of random local measurements into a non-linear dimensionality reduction algorithm, to determine with respect to which partitions a given quantum state is entangled.



#### Entanglement Witnesses

In this paper, **projector entanglement witnesses (EWs)**, also known as **fidelity-based EWs**, are used to detect specific types of entangled states, such as the W and GHZ states. These EWs operate by projecting the quantum state onto a target entangled state and evaluating the expectation value. If the expectation value falls below a certain threshold, this indicates entanglement.



The **EW for the** N **-qubit W state** is defined as:
$$
\mathcal{W}_{W_N}=\frac{N-1}{N}I-\vert W_N \rangle\langle W_N \vert
$$
where $I$ is the identity operator and $\vert W_N \rangle$ represents the W state. The expected minimum value of this witness is $-\frac{1}{N}$ , which is achieved when the state is an ideal W state.



The **EW for the** N **-qubit GHZ state** is given by:
$$
\mathcal{W}_{GHZ_N}=\frac{1}{2}1-\vert GHZ_N \rangle\langle GHZ_N \vert
$$
where $\vert GHZ_N \rangle$ represents the GHZ state. The minimum value of this witness is $-\frac{1}{2}$ , which indicates that the state closely matches the ideal GHZ state.

**Weaknesses of Projector EWs**

**High Sensitivity to Noise**:

 Projector EWs are effective only when the prepared state is close to the ideal target state. Even a small amount of noise can cause the witness to fail, making it challenging to detect entanglement in noisy environments like quantum hardware.

**Limited Detection in Mixed States**:

 These EWs are primarily designed for detecting entanglement in pure states or nearly pure states. When noise introduces mixedness, projector EWs struggle to detect entanglement reliably, often yielding false negatives where entangled states go undetected.

**Dependence on Specific State Structure**:

 Projector EWs are tailored for specific entangled structures (like W or GHZ). If the prepared state deviates from these exact structures, the witness may not recognize entanglement, even if other types of entanglement are present.



To address these weaknesses, the paper introduces **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)** as a machine-learning approach that is **state-agnostic (independent)**. UMAP leverages the statistical properties of random measurement data to classify and certify entanglement structures across various partitions, making it more robust to noise and effective for mixed states generated by quantum hardware.



#### Classification of Entanglement Partitions

The paper discusses the use of **UMAP (Uniform Manifold Approximation and Projection)** to classify entanglement partitions, aiming to distinguish different entanglement structures in noisy quantum states prepared on quantum hardware.



**Goal of UMAP**

The goal of UMAP in this context is to provide a robust method for identifying multipartite entanglement structures in quantum states, even under noise and mixed-state conditions. Unlike traditional entanglement witnesses, UMAP is used to classify entangled states across various partitions, capturing the specific correlations present in each partition type.
