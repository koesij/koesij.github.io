## Datta, Arya, Patrick Pietzonka, and Andre C. Barato. "Second law for active heat engines." *Physical Review X* 12.3 (2022): 031034.

### Abstract

>Here, by using a known inequality in stochastic thermodynamics for the excess entropy, we obtain a general second law for active heat engines, which does not involve the energy dissipation of the hidden degrees of freedom and is expressed in terms of quantities that can be measured directly from the observable degrees of freedom. Besides heat and work, our second law contains an information-theoretic term, which allows an active heat engine to extract work beyond the limits valid for a passive heat engine.
